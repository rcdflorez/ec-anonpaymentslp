            <p class="text-start paymentauth-copy">I authorize my financial institution to honor this electronic payment.
                This payment is for the repayment of a loan I have with Explore Credit.
                I understand that because this is an electronic transaction, these funds
                may be withdrawn from my account as soon as the above noted transaction
                date. In the case of recurring payments, I understand that this authorization
                will remain in effect until the schedule end date, or until I cancel it
                in writing, whichever comes first, and I agree to notify Explore Credit
                in writing of any changes in my account information or termination of this
                authorization immediately. If the above noted payment date falls on a weekend
                or holiday, I understand that the payment may be executed on the next business
                day. In the case of this transaction being rejected for Non Sufficient
                Funds (NSF) I understand that Explore Credit may at its discretion attempt
                to process the charge again within 30 days. I certify that I am an authorized
                user of this debit card or bank account, and that I will not dispute the
                payment with my Bank, so long as the transaction corresponds to the terms
                indicated below. Further, this authorization supersedes any previously
                provided authorization to withdraw funds using either this debit card or
                bank account.</p>
